# Welcome to client-alanquis-rustmagic (private)
This is the source code to alanquis-rustmagic. This repository is coded with NextJS version 13+. This is a framework built on React, which itself is built on Javascript.

The website is a leaderboard for the affiliate rust magic site. You can find the API docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWwgQoqV3Ql874WPWo3a3m5ub5pC43-PGnTOoOgFd7Y/edit#heading=h.pq1vepeahfvz).

## Update/ change the site simple follow these instructions:
1. Create a new directory in your local file explore/finder
2. Use Visual Studio code's built in `Source Control` and click `initialize repository`
3. Click the `3 dots` and click `clone`
4. Click clone from Github or enter this repository name or URL
5. Follow the instructions and click `open` 
6. You have now got the source code on your machine!
7. Now make your changes. Changes will appear red, yellow or green (depending on the action)
8. When done, simply go to `Source Control` and click `stage changes`. Then add a commit message, commit and push
9. Done! Vercel will automatically build the site for you and redeploy. This may take some time so your site may go down for a few seconds-minutes

## Git Basics
- If another developer pushes another update you will need to PULL the code
    1. You cannot have any changes when you do this , if so discard them or PUSH them to another branch
- When you want to PUSH your changes, and another developer already PUSHED before you, your code is classified as OLD. This means that your code is outdated, git will not let you push unless you PULL first **or create a new branch** and merge.

# The details of NextJS
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
